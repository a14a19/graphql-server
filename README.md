# Getting Started with [GraphQL.js](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/)

## Introduction to GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data. ([read more](https://graphql.org/learn/))

### Why choose GraphQL over REST

* GraphQL is good for large, complex, and interrelated data sources.
* GraphQL has a single URL endpoint.
* GraphQL returns data in a flexible structure defined by the client.
* GraphQL data is strongly typed. So the client receives data in predetermined and mutually understood formats.
* With GraphQL, invalid requests are typically rejected by schema structure. This results in an autogenerated error message.
